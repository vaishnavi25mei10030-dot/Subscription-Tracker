1. Problem Statement
People today use several recurring subscriptions, such as OTT platforms, cloud storage plans, gym memberships, mobile recharge packs, and software tools.
Managing all these subscriptions manually often leads to:
•	Missed payment deadlines
•	Unwanted auto-renewals
•	Difficulty remembering renewal dates
•	Overspending on unused services
There is a need for a simple, structured system to track all subscription details in one place and help users stay organized.
The Subscription Tracker solves this problem by providing a user-friendly platform to view, update, and manage subscriptions efficiently.
